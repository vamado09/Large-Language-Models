Large Language Models OpenAI experimentation #LargeLanguageModels

Welcome to the GitHub repository where I have compiled all my experimental work on Large Language Models (LLMs) conducted for my capstone projects. This repository is a comprehensive archive of the techniques and tools I explored while working with some of the most advanced AI models and frameworks currently available.

## Highlights of the Repository:
OpenAI API Usage: Extensive experimentation with OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 models, utilizing their capabilities for generating text and building intelligent applications.

Langchain Integration: Implementation of Langchain to enhance the conversational abilities of LLMs in practical applications.

Hugging Face Models: Utilization of Hugging Face's transformers for various natural language processing tasks.

FAISS Implementation: Experimentation with Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) to handle large-scale information retrieval effectively.

RAG Techniques: Basic implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhancing response generation by integrating external knowledge sources.

## Contributions to Capstone Groups:
This repository not only documents the individual experimentations but also highlights how these advancements and learnings have contributed significantly to the Virtual Tissue Simulation group and other capstone projects at Indiana University. The work documented here aims to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with LLMs, facilitating innovative solutions and enhancing the capabilities of various projects within the academic community.

## Purpose of This Repository:
The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a resource for fellow researchers and students who are exploring the realm of artificial intelligence, particularly those interested in the practical applications of large language models. By sharing these experimentations, I hope to inspire and equip others with the tools and knowledge to advance their own projects and research.
